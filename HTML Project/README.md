# My first website!
So, this is my first ever attempt at actually writing some code for a website, both back- and front-end. The whole website was coded by me, so it's janky andprobably super unoptimized, having a lot of useless code and, again, basicallyno comments (i will add some later) and... basically no way to be run outside ofyour local network. 

*_And yet, it is my finest work._*

The site itself is simple, some personal stuff and activities listed there for fun with the main feature being the ability to post comments, original. Those are stored on a local `mongodb` database, and are... nothing too special. You CAN adopt it to your needs or break your head (both in some cases) while trying to understand the code, so... off you go, *good luck~*


## Run Locally

Install mongodb locally (or register a ``mongodb atlas`` cluster if you can rewrite the code)

```bash
Here's a link: https://mongodb.com 
```
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone *enter link to project*
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  nodemon express.js
```
